The 2017 defence review reaf-firmed commitments to NATO, but also to modernising capabilities, including cyber power. The review promised to increase regular and reserve forces, with particular enhancements in the areas of cyber and intelligence. Canada’s deployments, although relatively small scale, underscore a determination to maintain both international engagement and power-projection capability. Canada’s leadership of a NATO battlegroup in Latvia highlights a continuing capability to deploy medium-sized land formations. It has also contributed to NATO’s air-policing mission. Meanwhile, the deployments of frigates and submarines to the NATO theatre and the Pacific dem-onstrate continuing blue-water naval capabilities. The 2017 review pledged to finally deliver on a range of delayed procurements. It raised the target for a new-generation fighter to 88 aircraft, but a trade dispute with Boeing saw Canada turn to Australia to purchase second-hand F/A-18s to supplement its current fleet. Contenders for the long-term fighter replacement include the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, the F-35A Lightning II and the Gripen E. In October 2018, the government selected the Lockheed Martin-led consortium and its BAE Systems Type-26 frigate design as the preferred bidder for Canada’s future surface combatant. Canada maintains a well-devel-oped range of mainly small and medium-sized defence firms. The strongest sector is in combat vehicles and components, though the government is using its latest naval procurements to establish a long-term national shipbuilding strategy.\\n\\n\\n\\nACTIVE 67,400 (Army 23,800 Navy 8,300 Air Force 12,000 Other 23,300) Paramilitary 4,500\\n\\n\\n\\nRESERVE 35,600 (Army 25,600 Navy 4,600 Air 2,100 Other 3,300)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tNorth America\\t43\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nORGANISATIONS BY SERVICE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpace\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEQUIPMENT BY TYPE\\n\\n\\n\\nSATELLITES • SPACE SURVEILLANCE 1 Sapphire\\n\\n\\n\\nArmy 23,800\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFORCES BY ROLE\\n\\nMANOEUVRE\\n\\nMechanised\\n\\n\\n\\n1 (1st) mech bde gp (1 armd regt, 2 mech inf bn, 1 lt inf bn, 1 arty regt, 1 cbt engr regt, 1 log bn)\\n\\n\\n\\n2 (2nd & 5th) mech bde gp (1 armd recce regt, 2 mech inf bn, 1 lt inf bn, 1 arty regt, 1 cbt engr regt, 1 log bn)\\n\\nCOMBAT SUPPORT\\n\\n1 engr regt\\n\\n3 MP pl\\n\\nAIR DEFENCE\\n\\n1 SAM regt\\n\\n\\n\\nEQUIPMENT BY TYPE\\n\\nARMOURED FIGHTING VEHICLES\\n\\nMBT 82: 42 Leopard 2A4 (trg role); 20 Leopard 2A4M\\n\\n(upgraded); 20 Leopard 2A6M (52 Leopard 1C2 in store)\\n\\nRECCE ε120 LAV-25 Coyote\\n\\nIFV 550 LAV 6.0\\n\\nAPC 443\\n\\nAPC (T) 268: 235 M113; 33 M577 (CP)\\n\\n\\n\\nAPC (W) 175 LAV Bison (incl 10 EW, 32 amb, 32 repair, 64 recovery)\\n\\nAUV 507: 7 Cougar; 500 TAPV\\n\\nENGINEERING & MAINTENANCE VEHICLES\\n\\nAEV 23: 5 Buffalo; 18 Wisent 2\\n\\nARV 12 BPz-3 Büffel\\n\\n\\n\\nANTI-TANK/ANTI-INFRASTRUCTURE MSL • MANPATS TOW-2\\n\\nRCL 84mm Carl Gustav\\n\\nARTILLERY 287\\n\\nTOWED 163 105mm 126: 98 C3 (M101); 28 LG1 MkII; 155mm 37 M777\\n\\nMOR 124: 81mm 100; SP 81mm 24 LAV Bison UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES • ISR • Light 5 RQ-21A Blackjack\\n\\n\\n\\nReserve Organisations 25,600\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanadian Rangers 5,250 Reservists\\n\\nProvide a limited military presence in Canada’s northern, coastal and isolated areas.

A missile-defence review was published in January 2019 envisaging a number of new programmes and technologies, including space-based systems, to respond to a more challenging and evolving threat environment. In August 2019 the Pentagon established a new Space Command as a precursor to the creation of a space force, a White House plan that has fuelled debate over the best way to integrate space into national-security policy. The US is NATO’s most capable member, and has defence-treaty obligations to, among others, Australia, the Philippines, Japan, South Korea and Thailand. The US maintains an all-volunteer force, including significant reserves, with high levels of training throughout all command and service levels. However, readiness remains a concern. Modernisation priorities include a renewal of strategic nuclear capabilities, including a new class of ballistic-missile submarine and a new long-range bomber, and a major recapitalisation of air assets across the services. In August 2019, the US withdrew from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and three weeks later conducted a ground-launched cruise-missile test. During 2019 the US Navy was carrying out a new force-structure assessment, which could adjust the long-term plan for a 355-ship combat fleet. The US also continues to actively develop its defensive and offensive cyber capabilities.

This followed the US Marine Corps and US Air Force declaring that the F-35B and F-35A had reached IOC in 2015 and 2016 respectively. The F-35C is planned to deploy as part of the air wing on the USS Carl Vinson in 2021.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMARCH\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBRADLEY RFP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe US issued a request for proposals for the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle. This is the US Army’s third attempt to replace the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, which entered service in the 1980s. The army wants to reduce risk by acquiring a basic vehicle design ‘off-the-shelf’. The US Army has already spent almost US$24 billion on two previous programmes before cancelling them and there is a growing need to replace the 40-year-old Bradley design.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAUGUST\\n\\nHYPERSONIC WEAPONS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe US Army awarded Dynetics and Lockheed Martin two contracts totalling US$698.6 million to produce a first prototype battery of the ground-launched Long Range Hypersonic Weapon. The army wants to field a system with a basic combat capability by 2023. China, France, Japan and Russia are also developing hypersonic glide vehicles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAUGUST\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCANADA’S FIGHTERS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence and Airbus Defence and Space withdrew the Eurofighter Typhoon from consideration in Canada’s Future Fighter Capability Project, which is intended to replace Canada’s F/A-18A/B Hornet s. Dassault withdrew the Rafale in late 2018. Canada identified a requirement to replace its Hornets as far back as 2008 and selected the Lockheed Martin F-35 in 2010. This decision was then put on hold before the contest was relaunched in 2016. Concern has been expressed in the Canadian media that other competitors, such as Boeing with the F/A-18 Super Hornet and Saab with the Gripen, may also withdraw, effectively ending the competition. Canada expects to spend C$15–19bn (US$11.58– 14.66bn) on the procurement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARV\\n\\nSEPTEMBER\\n\\n\\n\\nThe US Navy stated that it had awarded contracts to two firms to develop a technology demonstrator for the US Marine Corps’ Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle programme, which aims to replace the 1980s-era Light Armored Vehicle (LAV). General Dynamics Land Systems will design a vehicle using contemporary technologies, while SAIC will develop a vehicle that is based on technologies yet to fully mature.

The US Navy wanted a class of over 50 ships designed to operate in coastal shallow waters and perform anti-submarine-warfare, mine-countermeasures and surface-warfare missions. In a novel acquisition process, the navy would trial two classes of prototype ‘seaframes’ before deciding which to pursue for full-rate production. It would also develop mission packages for each role that could be changed depending on the required task. Increased automation and greater reliance on shore-based logistics would also enable a smaller crew. The plan was that three crews would rotate between two ships, with one of these forward-deployed and the other training or working-up (the 3-2-1 plan).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTroubled status\\n\\nHowever, by the end of 2019 only 19 LCSs were in service. The plan is to now build 35 hulls. In 2007, the navy cancelled its cost-plus contract with Lockheed Martin for its second vessel (LCS 3), as well as several others budgeted with the ‰rm and General Dynamics, due to the expected price more than doubling to around US$350 million. The navy, General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin later agreed two ‰xed-price contracts worth US$433.69m for LCS 3 and LCS 4. In late 2010, the navy decided to buy both the Freedom- and Independence-class designs. The argument was that reduced seaframe costs allowed both to be procured; the navy could therefore obtain ships more rapidly; and that it would improve investment in the naval-shipbuilding sector. However, both Congress and government auditors said that operating two different ship classes would lead to higher maintenance, training and upgrade costs. Meanwhile, all three mission packages are behind schedule and, although the surface-warfare package achieved initial operating\\n\\n\\n\\nLittoral Combat Ship: commissioned vessels’ production rate\\n\\n\\n\\nFreedom class\\n\\n\\n\\nMar 2023\\n\\n\\n\\nJun 2020\\n\\n\\n\\nSep 2017\\n\\n\\n\\nDec 2014\\n\\n\\n\\nJan 2012\\n\\n\\n\\nJul 2009\\n\\n\\n\\nOct 2006\\n\\n\\n\\nJan 2004\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFreedom class (LCS 1)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndependence class (LCS 2)\\n\\n\\n\\ncapability (IOC) in 2014, this was in part because the navy temporarily reduced the minimum requirements. All three mission packages are due to reach IOC in 2021.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe future\\n\\nA programme review in 2016 saw the 3-2-1 crew plan replaced. Each LCS would have two crews (Blue/Gold) that would rotate, as in the submarine service. A mission package would be attached to each LCS, which would then be grouped into a surface division, based on their common role.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe LCS programme is at a crucial point. The ‰nal Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate was retired in 2015 and the 11 Avenger-class mine-countermeasure vessels are approximately 25–30 years old. At the same time, rešecting current concerns, the navy is planning to build a larger, more heavily armed and more expensive FFG(X) frigate. But in the meantime, the navy needs the LCS to begin operating with its forward-deployed šeets.\\n\\n\\n\\nIndependence class\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Commissioned\\n\\n\\n\\n Delivered\\n\\n\\n\\n Launched\\n\\n\\n\\n Keel laid\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNorth America\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n3\\n\\n5\\n\\n7\\n\\n9\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\n15\\n\\n17\\n\\n2\\n\\n4\\n\\n6\\n\\n8\\n\\n10\\n\\n12\\n\\n14\\n\\n16\\n\\n18\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nS\\n\\nS\\n\\nS\\n\\nS\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nS\\n\\nS\\n\\nS\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLC\\n\\nLC\\n\\nLC\\n\\nLC\\n\\nLC\\n\\nS\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nS\\n\\nS\\n\\nLC\\n\\nLC\\n\\nLC\\n\\nLC\\n\\nS\\n\\nS\\n\\nS\\n\\nLCS\\n\\nS\\n\\nLCS\\n\\n© IISS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLC\\n\\nLC\\n\\n\\n\\nLC\\n\\nLC\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLC\\n\\nLC\\n\\nLC\\n\\n\\n\\nLC\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 5 Littoral Combat Ship programme: planned and achieved IOC dates\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSystem\\n\\nPlanned initial\\n\\nAchieved initial\\n\\n\\n\\noperational capability\\n\\noperational capability\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFreedom-class (LCS 1) seaframe\\n\\n2007\\n\\n2014\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndependence-class (LCS 2) seaframe\\n\\n2008\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMine-countermeasures mission package\\n\\n2008\\n\\n2021*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSurface-warfare mission package (surface-to-surface missile capability)\\n\\n2010 (2011)\\n\\n2014 (2019)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnti-submarine-warfare mission package\\n\\n2010\\n\\n2020*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* Planned'"
